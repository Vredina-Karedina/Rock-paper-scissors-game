# Rock-paper-scissors-game
The game rules:
A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss.
A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"[4]), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper").
If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
